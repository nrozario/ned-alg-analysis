# ned-alg-analysis

This repo holds all the code written as part of the Ned algorithm analysis. 

Presentation with current state of results can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fog-udJjPj5mkDrx2JtumdPGhOl6K4is_4v9gRMVYAg/edit?usp=sharing)

**au_pipeline.py** converts the SAPCR data into the proper format for the Ned algorithm.

**analysis.ipynb** is mostly unused now, it holds the analysis done before the segmentation methodology was developed. It is kept here just in case but shouldn't be necessary for any future analysis.

**segment_analysis.ipynb** is the main analysis notebook. It contains the code for the bulk of the analysis including the segmentation, visualisations, and chi-square tests.

**sampling.ipynb** is used to generate a sample of the SAPCR data and compare distributions within the sample to the original data to make sure that it is a representative sample.

**hand_labelling.ipynb** is used to compare the results of the hand labelling to the alert states generated by the Ned algorithm.
